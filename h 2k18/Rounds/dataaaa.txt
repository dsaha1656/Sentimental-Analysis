@JohnVerdejo Mannn I can't count how many times I've had the '#PR's power grid needs some serious updating' conversation...
Up on melancholy hill

Dropped my phone in the sink earlier.No sound, but everythin else works.Prepared myself for life without music until I put my earphones in
B day next week, catch the sauce and watch the heaviness!
@GrimsToyShow @hunna_chunna you got hacked on your gaming channel grim by evil wood clowns yesterday September 20 and September 21 today

@MUTGuru I know guys that sink $1000s into the game and only to build a team and play solos. But this hear you make nothing on solos.

Some questions you get on Twitter make you want to despair. We've been so battered. We complain but aren't convinced things could be better.

@modelady24 I know, right? I had a tinge of the same thought. Glad it's Six from BSG, though. Happy the show stayed consistent after break.

@Orrible_Ives I didn't say anything bad about the situation great mate, can't believe some were. Makes me despair of humanity
I know I've painted quite a grim picture of your chances. But if you simply stand here, we will both surely die.
I honestly feel nothing towards either of my parents and it's pretty depressing
@AshleyCWilson @MrDavidHobbs @IndyCaronNBCSN Glad the TV coverage was so successful because the attendance looked pretty dismal.
@OzelleM man imagine # Ultra is promoting carnival. I think u need to be the chairperson #serious. Cause am hearing nothing

On the wheel as we grow older and become aware of ourselves as individuals with a dull responsibility in life?
@childctweets sad people are that sick and boring 😬😬😬
This whole #VanRE + extradition might turn into a Pandora's box. JT has no idea about that murky corrupt guanxi in China; Toad vs Dada ;-)
@MarkedMurderer Orion's eyes narrowed as he gazed down at the girl, ice cold blues meeting a softer than usual green. His instinct told him-
Well I won't be doing a unboxing of the iPhone 7 plus on my channel until November sadly. Thank you @TMobile @Apple Staten Island NY smh
@RealTimBooth I've never been fond of having dark eyes until seeing this share.

I saw those dreams dashed &amp;&amp; divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over &amp;&amp; over again ~ sparkling &amp;&amp; broken.
Boy oh boy! our weekday schedule is crazy! But no matter how tired I am I do whatever it takes to keep the smile on Kai's face from a frown
@SussexMistress @sarahb45 @MsEvilyne @MissJessicaWood I'd be perched on that, unfortunately wrapped in heavy chains! #sink...
@flybe Doesn't explain the ability to land at Manchester but not Bradford - other than more convenient for Flybe. Many unhappy travelers

@Aamnaa___ @drkarthik_n your per capita income is almost same like us. Gini Coefficient is very dismal. Ambitions are high but output Zero.
