This facilitates communication and keeps everyone organized, says Slattery. This is useful even when your lives are less hectic, like when the kids are out of school and too much unstructured time creates anxiety. When that's the case, Slattery suggests creating slots for physical exercise, brain exercise (such as reading), social interaction, and playtime each week. \"The big areas I emphasize are consistency and routines,\" she says. \"The predictability and stability of what we do and when goes a long way.\" ",null,null,null,"tasks\/22.jpg",null],
["41","Split the housework"," According to a Pew Research Survey from 2007, 62% of couples say that sharing the chores is \"very important\" for a happy relationship. The only two other factors that ranked as more important than sharing chores were faithfulness and having a  strong relationship. And sharing chores ranked higher in importance than sharing religious beliefs, sharing political beliefs, and making enough money. It's that important. That held true across genders, ages, and even relationship status.  Here's a tip for how to make each other very happy when it comes to household tasks: Each of you promises to do one of the chores that the other one loathes. So if you hate doing the laundry, your bae can always handle it. But that's only if you solemnly vow to always be the one to clean the kitty litter box (because she just can't even with that scooper). Then remember to say thank you.

["42","What Makes a Family Strong and Successful","There are at least five \"L's\" which contribute to strong family relationships. Learning\u2014Families are where we learn values, skills, and behavior. Strong families manage and control their learning experiences.  Loyalty\u2014Strong families have a sense of loyalty and devotion toward family members. The family sticks together. They stand by each other during times of trouble.. Loyalty builds through sickness and health, want and good fortune, failure and success, and all the things the family faces.  Love is at the heart of the family. All humans have the need to love and to be loved; the family is normally the place where love is expressed. Laughter is good family medicine. Humor is an escape valve for family tension. Through laughter we learn to see ourselves honestly and objectively.  Leadership is essential. Family members, usually the adults, must assume responsibility for leading the family.
